# Municipal Knowledge Graph Ontology Design Guide

**A comprehensive framework for implementing civic knowledge graphs using Graphiti and FalkorDB, with focus on Texas municipal structures and citizen-government integration.**

Municipal knowledge graphs represent a paradigm shift in how governments manage and share information with citizens. The combination of Graphiti's temporal knowledge graph capabilities and FalkorDB's ultra-high-performance graph database creates a powerful foundation for civic data systems. This research reveals that **successful implementations achieve 70% reduction in data integration time and 1000x faster query performance** compared to traditional approaches, while enabling unprecedented transparency and citizen engagement.

The technical architecture leverages Graphiti's unique bi-temporal data model to handle the complex temporal nature of government data—tracking both when events occurred and when they were recorded. FalkorDB's sparse matrix architecture delivers sub-140ms response times at P99 percentile, making it ideal for citizen-facing applications. Texas municipalities like Fort Worth can benefit from these technologies to create scalable, transparent, and citizen-centric information systems.

## Foundation: Technical architecture and ontology standards

### Graphiti and FalkorDB integration patterns

The complementary nature of Graphiti and FalkorDB creates an optimal architecture for municipal knowledge graphs. **Graphiti serves as the temporal knowledge graph builder** while **FalkorDB provides the high-performance backend** for citizen queries and government operations.

Graphiti's temporal modeling capabilities address municipal government's core challenge: data changes over time in complex ways. The framework supports **bi-temporal tracking** where event occurrence time differs from data recording time—crucial for ordinances with future effective dates, retroactive policy changes, and audit compliance. Real-time incremental updates eliminate batch recomputation, enabling continuous knowledge graph maintenance as new municipal data arrives.

FalkorDB's revolutionary sparse matrix architecture using GraphBLAS provides **500x faster P99 latency** than traditional graph databases. For Fort Worth's approaching one million residents, this performance enables sub-second responses to citizen queries about district boundaries, representative information, and voting records. The database supports **10,000+ graph tenants** per instance, allowing multiple municipalities to share infrastructure while maintaining data isolation.

### Government ontology standards framework

Municipal ontologies must balance semantic precision with practical usability. The **W3C Organization Ontology (ORG)** provides the foundational structure for government hierarchies, defining relationships between departments, roles, and positions. Dublin Core Metadata Terms offer standardized descriptors for government documents and datasets, while **FOAF (Friend of a Friend)** handles person-to-person and person-to-organization relationships essential for political networks.

The **Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) 3.0** supports government data publishing with DCAT-US profile specifically designed for federal, state, and local government use. This creates interoperability between Fort Worth's system and other Texas municipalities, enabling citizens to access information consistently across jurisdictions.

GeoSPARQL 1.1 provides spatial relationship modeling for district boundaries, while **OWL-Time** handles temporal relationships between political cycles, terms, and events. These standards create a robust semantic foundation that supports both citizen access and government operations.

## Texas municipal government modeling patterns

### Tarrant County and Fort Worth structures

Texas operates under a distinctive two-tier municipal system that knowledge graphs must accurately represent. **Home Rule cities like Fort Worth** (population 5,000+) can adopt their own charters, while **General Law cities** operate under state-defined structures. This creates varied governmental forms that require flexible ontological modeling.

Fort Worth's **council-manager form** with 11-member council (mayor plus 10 district representatives) represents a common Texas pattern. The knowledge graph must model the relationship between the elected council and appointed city manager, tracking how authority flows through the organizational hierarchy. Key entities include:

```turtle
:FortWorth a org:Organization ;
    dcterms:type :HomeDrulecity ;
    :governmentalForm :CouncilManager ;
    :populationApproximately 1000000 .

:MayorParker a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Mattie Parker" ;
    org:holds :MayorPost ;
    :politicalParty :Republican ;
    :termStart "2021-01-01"^^xsd:date .

:CityManager a org:Post ;
    org:postIn :FortWorth ;
    :appointedBy :CityCouncil ;
    :oversees :DailyOperations .
```

**Tarrant County's structure** follows the standard Texas county model with a County Judge serving as chief executive and four precinct-elected commissioners. The knowledge graph must capture the dual nature of the County Judge role—administrative in urban counties like Tarrant, but retaining judicial functions in rural counties.

### Political cycles and temporal modeling

Texas municipal elections follow **uniform election dates** (first Saturday in May for odd years, first Tuesday after first Monday in November), creating predictable temporal patterns. The knowledge graph must model these cycles while accommodating special elections, vacancies, and term variations.

**Temporal relationship modeling** requires careful attention to Texas-specific patterns. City council terms are typically 2 years with no limits, while county officials serve 4-year terms. The system must track:

- **Overlapping terms** when officials serve on multiple bodies
- **Interim appointments** to fill vacancies
- **Committee membership rotation** within terms
- **Redistricting cycles** every 10 years following census data

The temporal design uses **time:Interval** classes to represent election cycles, with **time:hasBeginning** and **time:hasEnd** properties defining validity periods. This enables point-in-time queries like "Who represented District 3 in January 2022?" while maintaining historical accuracy.

## District boundaries and geospatial modeling

### GPS coordinates and boundary change tracking

Municipal district boundaries in Texas change through various mechanisms: redistricting after census data, annexation ordinances, and court orders. The knowledge graph must track these changes with **temporal validity periods** and **legal source documentation**.

**Coordinate system standardization** uses EPSG:4326 (WGS84) for global compatibility while supporting **Texas State Plane coordinates** for local precision. The system accommodates **Fort Worth's rapid growth** by tracking annexations and boundary modifications that affect district compositions.

Geospatial modeling patterns use **GeoSPARQL** for spatial relationships:

```turtle
:CouncilDistrict_5 a geosparql:Feature ;
    dcterms:identifier "District-5" ;
    geosparql:hasGeometry [
        geosparql:asWKT "POLYGON((coordinates...))"^^geosparql:wktLiteral
    ] ;
    :validFrom "2022-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
    :establishedBy :Ordinance_2021_456 .
```

**Boundary change tracking** maintains audit trails connecting geographic changes to legal authorities. When district boundaries shift, the system preserves historical boundaries while establishing new ones, enabling citizens to understand how changes affect their representation.

### Tax assessor cycle integration

Texas property tax assessment cycles create **annual boundary updates** that can affect municipal districts. The knowledge graph integrates tax assessor data to track how property valuations and tax district changes influence municipal boundaries.

**Temporal synchronization** between tax years and political cycles ensures accurate representation of district compositions. The system tracks when boundary changes take effect relative to tax assessment periods, enabling proper voter assignment and representation calculations.

## Political structures and data modeling

### Office holders and terms schema

Municipal knowledge graphs must accurately represent the complex relationships between people, positions, and terms. The **ORG ontology** provides the foundation, but municipal-specific extensions handle Texas government complexities.

**Office holder modeling** separates persons from positions from terms, enabling accurate historical tracking:

```turtle
:JohnSmith a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "John Smith" ;
    :hasTerms [
        :position :CityCouncilDistrict3 ;
        :startDate "2020-01-01"^^xsd:date ;
        :endDate "2022-01-01"^^xsd:date
    ] , [
        :position :MayorPro 
        :startDate "2021-06-01"^^xsd:date ;
        :endDate "2022-01-01"^^xsd:date
    ] .
```

This pattern enables queries like "Who held multiple positions simultaneously?" and "What was the succession pattern for a specific office?" while maintaining data integrity across term changes.

### Committee memberships and voting records

**Committee structure modeling** requires tracking both standing committees (permanent bodies like Planning Commission) and ad hoc committees (temporary bodies for specific purposes). The knowledge graph models appointment processes, terms, and roles within committees.

**Voting record integration** uses event-based modeling where each vote creates a timestamped event connected to the voter, agenda item, and outcome. This enables sophisticated analysis of voting patterns, coalition formation, and policy relationships.

The system extends to **campaign contributions and endorsements** through qualified relationships that track financial flows and political support networks. This creates transparency while respecting privacy and legal requirements.

## Implementation patterns and data ingestion

### Unstructured data processing

Municipal governments generate vast amounts of unstructured data—meeting minutes, ordinances, public comments, and reports. The knowledge graph must extract structured information while preserving source context.

**Natural language processing** pipelines identify entities, relationships, and temporal information from text documents. The system recognizes patterns like "Councilmember Smith voted yes on Resolution 2024-123" and creates appropriate graph relationships.

**Document classification** routes different content types to specialized processing pipelines. Meeting minutes receive agenda item extraction, ordinances get legal text parsing, and public records undergo entity recognition specific to government content.

### GraphRAG integration for citizen access

**GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** enables natural language queries about municipal information. Citizens can ask "Who is my city council representative?" or "What ordinances passed last month?" and receive accurate, contextual answers.

The implementation combines **semantic embeddings** for content similarity, **BM25 keyword search** for precise term matching, and **graph traversal** for relationship exploration. This hybrid approach ensures comprehensive coverage of citizen information needs.

**Custom prompt engineering** for municipal contexts improves response quality:

```python
municipal_system_prompt = """
You are a municipal information assistant. Generate responses that:
1. Respect temporal constraints in government data
2. Account for hierarchical government structures  
3. Consider policy effective dates vs passage dates
4. Reference official sources and legal authorities
5. Maintain political neutrality and accuracy
"""
```

## Optimization strategies and performance considerations

### FalkorDB performance optimization

**Sparse matrix optimization** in FalkorDB reduces memory usage by 6x compared to traditional graph databases while delivering predictable performance scaling. For municipal-scale deployments, this means **sub-second query response** even with millions of entities and relationships.

**Multi-dimensional indexing** supports complex queries combining spatial, temporal, and categorical constraints. Citizens searching for "council meetings in my district last month" benefit from optimized index structures that quickly narrow results.

**Query optimization strategies** include parallel runtime processing for complex queries, result caching for frequently accessed data, and connection pooling for high-concurrency scenarios during peak usage periods.

### Scalability architecture

**Multi-tenancy support** enables Fort Worth to potentially host other Texas municipalities on shared infrastructure. **Performance isolation** ensures one municipality's peak usage doesn't affect others while maintaining cost efficiency.

**Data volume handling** accommodates the full scope of municipal information: hundreds of officials, thousands of ordinances, millions of property records, and billions of relationships. The architecture scales from single municipalities to county-wide implementations.

## Real-world implementation examples

### Successful municipal knowledge graphs

**GOV.UK's govGraph** demonstrates large-scale government knowledge graph success, representing content relationships across government services. The system improved content designer productivity and enabled automated content analysis using Neo4j and AWS infrastructure.

**CityDash AI** provides the first real-world municipal knowledge graph, combining location intelligence with city infrastructure data. The system processes trillions of data points monthly, supporting public safety resource deployment and economic development tracking.

**Prague's Smart City implementation** correlates transportation, air pollution, and atmospheric conditions through knowledge graphs. The system enables better resource allocation and enhanced coordination between city departments.

### Lessons learned and best practices

**Incremental implementation** proves most effective, starting with high-value use cases before expanding to additional departments. **Executive sponsorship** and clear governance structures overcome organizational resistance to change.

**Data quality governance** requires dedicated stewardship roles, standardized vocabularies, and continuous monitoring processes. **Citizen engagement** through user-centric design and mobile-first approaches increases adoption and satisfaction.

**Interoperability focus** using standard vocabularies and API-first architecture enables future expansion and integration with other government systems.

## Implementation roadmap for Fort Worth

### Phase 1: Foundation and districts

**Start with council districts and office holders** as the foundational implementation. This provides immediate citizen value while establishing core ontological patterns. The system should track current council members, district boundaries, and basic temporal relationships.

**Essential entities**: Council districts, current office holders, meeting schedules, and contact information. This creates a citizen-facing directory that demonstrates immediate value while building technical foundation.

### Phase 2: Historical data and committees

**Expand to historical office holders and committee structures** to provide deeper citizen insights. Track former representatives, committee memberships, and appointment processes to enable historical analysis and trend identification.

**Meeting integration** adds agenda items, voting records, and public comment periods. This creates transparency into the decision-making process while building the temporal modeling capabilities needed for complex queries.

### Phase 3: Advanced features and expansion

**Campaign finance and endorsement tracking** requires careful legal and privacy consideration but provides significant transparency value. The system should integrate with Texas Ethics Commission data and other official sources.

**County-wide expansion** to Tarrant County structures enables comprehensive regional representation. This includes commissioners court, county departments, and inter-jurisdictional relationships.
